# Speaking

As you know by now, I love speaking about stuff I've learned or am learning currently. I've spoken at various conferences, meetups, and webinars. I'm always looking for opportunities to share my knowledge and learn from others.

## Previous Talks

You will find the decks and recordings of most of my talks here. There is a separate folder for each talk, which contains the deck and a link to the recording (if available).

## Speaking at your event

First of all, thank you for considering me as a speaker for your event. I'm excited to learn more about your event and how I can contribute to it. Before we get started, I want to ensure we're aligned on a few important details. This [rider](./rider.md) outlines what I need to deliver the best talk possible while being transparent, accessible, and inclusive. Please go though it before reaching out to me.
