# Speaking

As you know, I love speaking about stuff I've learned or am currently learning. I've spoken at various conferences, meetups, and webinars. I always seek opportunities to share my knowledge and learn from others.

## Previous Talks

You will find the decks and recordings (if recorded and available) of most of my talks folder wise with names of the events in this repository.

## Speaking at your event

First of all, thank you for considering me as a speaker for your event. I'm excited to learn more about your event and how I can contribute to it. Before we get started, I want to ensure we're aligned on a few important details. This [rider](./RIDER.md) outlines what I need to deliver the best talk possible while being transparent, accessible, and inclusive. Please go through it before reaching out to me.
