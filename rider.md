# Speaker Rider  

> Last updated: 19 December 2024  

Hi there!  

I LOVE speaking, and I’m thrilled you’re interested in having me at your event. Before we get started, I want to ensure we’re aligned on a few important details. This rider outlines what I need to deliver the best talk possible while being transparent, accessible, and inclusive.  


## Speaking Topics  

I’m happy to speak on a variety of topics, including (but not limited to):  

- Open Source  
- DevOps  
- CNCF Projects (Kubernetes, Prometheus, etc.)  
- Docker  
- Golang  
- Security  

## Accommodation and Travel  

- I require my travel and accommodation expenses to be fully covered for the entire duration of the conference.  
- For international conferences, I need at least one extra night of lodging prior to the event, as I typically arrive a day or two before the conference begins.  
- If travel and accommodation are booked on my behalf, I request that arrangements be made at my convenience and that all necessary details are provided in advance. If I book these myself, I request prompt reimbursement upon submission of receipts (as soon as humanly possible).  

## Tickets  

As a speaker, I ask for a full-access ticket to the conference. This allows me to engage with attendees, network with other speakers, and attend sessions by fellow presenters.  

## Accessibility and Inclusion  

- Ensure the venue is accessible to people with disabilities, including wheelchair access, ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms.  
- Ensure the conference have a safe environment for everyone. This includes implementing and enforcing a Code of Conduct.  
- Ensure the conference is inclusive of all people, regardless of background, gender, race, or identity.  

## Final Thoughts  

If you’re interested in having me speak, please provide the following:  
- Confirmation that you’ve read this speaker rider, along with any questions or criteria you may not be able to meet.  
- Conference name, website, event dates, and location.  
- A tentative or confirmed speaker list.  
- Details on the topic or session you’d like me to present.  

Thank you! I look forward to speaking at your event!
